# Flipkart Clone

> This project is a clone of the Flipkart website that I created using HTML and CSS. I followed a tutorial on YouTube to learn the fundamentals of web development and design. It was a great learning experience that helped me enhance my skills and understand how real-world websites are built.

## Features

- Implemented navigation bar, product listings, and search functionality.
- Styled using CSS to match the original Flipkart design.

## What I Learned

- HTML structure and semantics.
- CSS styling and layout techniques.
- Implementing navigation menus and search bars.

## Note on Responsiveness

Please note that this project is not fully responsive. It was primarily developed for learning purposes, and I focused on understanding HTML and CSS concepts. While the project layout may not adapt well to all screen sizes, I gained valuable insights into web development and design during this process.

## About the Project

I created this Flipkart clone quite a while ago as a part of my journey into web development. It was one of my initial projects where I learned to translate design concepts into code. While the code may not be as refined as my current projects, it holds a special place in my learning journey. Please keep in mind that my skills have evolved since then.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the Flipkart clone.
3. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different CSS styles.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the creator of the YouTube tutorial for providing clear instructions and guidance throughout the project.
